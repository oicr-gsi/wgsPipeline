# sample-fingerprinting

This [SeqWare](http://seqware.github.io/) workflow detects putative sample swaps using alignment files.

#### Workflow

Ths is a two-part workflow, workflow-fingerprint-collector and workflow-sample-fingerprinting work in tandem.
The source code for both sample-fingerprinting and fingerprint-collector SeqWare workflow is freely available from github at https://github.com/oicr-gsi .

#### Decider
For most workflows, the recommended way to configure and launch workflow runs is by using a [decider](http://seqware.github.io/docs/6-pipeline/basic_deciders/). Deciders query SeqWare's metadata repository, looking for appropriate files to launch against.
